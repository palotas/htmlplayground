								<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
								<p>
									Selenium is an open source browser automation framework and quickly becoming the world’s number one solution for web test automation. The tool allows for highly scalable test automation solutions with a very low maintenance effort and covers all browsers. Some of the largest companies on the web are using and actively supporting Selenium. 
									Selenium has also the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make it a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.
