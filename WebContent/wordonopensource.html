			<p>While Open Source software is free and cost is an ever important factor for businesses, there are many more great reasons for the use of open source. 
				Open source enables you to innovate within your organization at the speed that you need to. 
				If you are using 3rd party vendor tools cannot control the speed of innovation 
				and you rely completely on an external development or innovation cycle. So it is kind of like allowing a 3rd party
				to decide how quickly you can grow and expand your business.</p>
				
			<p>Open source certainly requires a different mindset in order to be successful. While open source gives you a lot of flexibility it also puts a lot of responsibility 
				into your hands - which I think is a good thing. Open Source empowers you to use the software in the way you need to (and not how a 3rd party vendor prescribes it to you). 
				You are in the driver seat and can decide how fast (or slow) you go.</p>
			
			<p>In today's world good engineers are very scarce. Hiring (or the inability to hire) is one of the main factors why companies cannot stay competitive.</p>
				<p>Below are a few advantages of open source software in relation to hiring: 
				<ul>
					<li>access to much larger resource pool</li>
					<li>reduced ramp up times for new hires</li>
					<li>increased employee engagement</li>
					<li>worldwide recognition for employees who contribute back to open source</li>
					<li>... and last but not least it is free</li>
				</ul>
