			<p>Open Source is free. Of course that is an important factor. However we at Gridfusion see an even more important factor for using open source tools. 
				Open source enables you to innovate within your organization at the speed that you need to. If you are using 3rd party vendor tools you are at the mery of the tool vendor
				and you rely completely on an external development or innovation cycle. So it is kind of like allowing a 3rd party
				to decide how quickly you can grow and expand your business.</p>
				
			<p>Open source certainly requires a different mindset in order to be successful. When you use a 3rd party tool and something doesn't work or you need 
				a new feature, you can pick up the phone or send them an email and the ball is in their hands. Open source works different. There is nobody to call 
				who you can pass on resposnsibility to. While at fiest this may seem a bot odd, it actually completely empowers you to be in the driver seat for your business
				You are in full control over what you want, what you need and how quickly your organization will have it.
			</p>
			
			<p>In today's world goor engineers are very scarce. Hiring (or the inability to hire) is one of the main factors why companies cannot stay competitive. 
				Using open source software gives you access to a much larger resurce pool. As well it greatly reduces ramp up times for new employees</p>
