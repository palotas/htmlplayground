		<p>Why, what, when, who and how should you automate your tests? While these seem like easy questions 
			we strongly recommend to spend some time on each of these questions before you start out. Below is our 
			point of view:</p>
		<p>
			<ul class="checkmarklist">
				<li>WHY?</li>
				<p>Saving time and to be able to reinvest that time into higher level and higher value test activities shuold 
					be your primary goal. Regression testing is usually a repetitive but very time consuming task, especially in agile 
					environments where you will see a regression test case explosion from iteration to iteration.

				<li>WHAT?</li>
				<p>The prime candidate for test automation is regression testing. While this may seem very obvious, many organizations
					try to automate everything. We recommend only to automate the tests that

				<li>WHEN?</li>
				<p>Of course as early as possible and ideally before the iteration is over. Even better if you have a TDD approach where the tests
					are written before the business logic. However in our opinion it is perfectly ok to automate after the release has gone out. In many cases the 
					product is not stable during the iterations and therefore trying to keep up with automation can sometimes be challenging.
